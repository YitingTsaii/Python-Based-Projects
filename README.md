We first define the parenthesis form and the printed form of a binary tree. For example, the parenthesis form of the binary tree below is <br /> 12(- 15(- 76(23 99))), and the printed form is on its right hand side.

Given a sequence of keys S, our task is to insert the elements of S into an initially empty standard binary tree T (and a splay tree, respectively) in the given order, and then output the following:

  (1) the parenthesis form of tree T
  (2) the printed form of tree T
  (3) the left boundary of tree T
